# Export and Visualization Schema's Versions from JSON Data

The goal of this project is to export and visualize the different versions (schema) of the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) data format. The processing of input files (JSON) is done with the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and the help of the library [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson). The visualization is done with the tool [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart), specifically with [Org Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/orgchart), in [HTML](https://html.com/) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/).

## Benchamrk

The benchmark was performed with the tool [JMH](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) with small size input files first and then with bigger size. As a result, the comparison was made between the Java's libraries, that support parsing of Json data format, to find out which one is faster.

### Libraries

* [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)
* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)
* [JSON-P](https://javaee.github.io/jsonp/)
* [Json-simple](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/)
* [mJson](https://bolerio.github.io/mjson/)

### Run
<b>mvn install</b><br/>
<b>java -jar target/benchmarks.jar</b>

### Results

<div align="center"><b>Small Files Table</b></div>

<div align="center"><img src="/benchmark/small_files_table.png"/></div>

<div align="center"><b>Big Files Table</b></div>

<div align="center"><img src="/benchmark/big_files_table.png"/></div>

The tables show the Jackson library is fast to both cases.

## Running the tests

The tests about some crucial methods are in the package testing. The framework [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) was used.

## Visualization

After the processing of the data the next step was to show the results to the user with a nice way to help him understand the differences between the versions. With JavaScript, HTML and the tool Google Charts the user is able to watch a chart with the versions through a browser.

### Example of Visualization
**Input file: cards.json**<br/>

## Output Files

Once the processing of the data is finished, output files will be created so that each file contains the versions that found in the input file.
